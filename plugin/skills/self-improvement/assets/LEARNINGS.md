# Learnings

Corrections, insights, and knowledge gaps captured during development.

**Categories**: correction | knowledge_gap | best_practice
**Areas**: frontend | backend | infra | tests | docs | config
**Statuses**: pending | in_progress | resolved | wont_fix | promoted | promoted_to_skill

Every saved entry, including a one-off pending learning, includes:

```markdown
### Context Maintenance
- Decay-Type: reality | decision | dependency | relevance | unknown
- Decay-Rate: fast | medium | slow | durable | unknown (brief basis)
- Authority: source or unknown; Owner: known role or unknown
- Revalidation: method; invalidating triggers; when to check; unavailable-source behavior
- Validation: pending | verified | unresolved; Last-Validated: date or none; Evidence: checked source or none
- Disposition: unassessed | retain | revise | externalize | retire; Application: proposed | applied
```

Classify at capture; do not mark a claim verified merely because it was logged.
Review unpromoted entries too. Review alone does not add recurrence or justify
retirement. See `references/context-maintenance.md` in the self-improvement skill.

## Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Not yet addressed |
| `in_progress` | Actively being worked on |
| `resolved` | Issue fixed or knowledge integrated |
| `wont_fix` | Decided not to address (reason in Resolution) |
| `promoted` | Elevated to CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, or copilot-instructions.md |
| `promoted_to_skill` | Extracted as a reusable skill |

## Skill Extraction Fields

When a learning is promoted to a skill, add these fields:

```markdown
**Status**: promoted_to_skill
**Skill-Path**: skills/skill-name
```

Example:
```markdown
